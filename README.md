# SMTP-Protocol-Simulation-Project
 Developed with my team a simulation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to demonstrate how email transmission works between mail servers. The project shows the sending, routing, and delivery process of emails while enhancing understanding of network protocols and client-server communication.
